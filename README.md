# Extended Kalman Filter

The goal of this project is to utilize the Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter to estimate the state of a bicycle moving around the car with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

## Build and Launch

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). Once the install for [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./ExtendedKF
```
